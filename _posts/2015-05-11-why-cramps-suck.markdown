Generally, I'm pretty satisfied with the two X chromosomes I was handed at conception. As a woman, I get to wear floral dresses, indulge in retail therapy, clack around in heels, squeal at the sight of babies (both human and animal alike), and bond with other women by gossiping about other women, just to name a few benefits. <br>
However, all of these benefits and more are instantly forgotten when the time of the month arrives a.k.a. the dreaded apocalypse during which I not only lose a load of blood, but also most of my sanity and humanity. <br>
For the more dim-witted peeps, I am referring to PERIODS. I am also refusing to feel shame talking about them. They happen every month and we all know that the feminine hygiene and birth control industries have thrived on these occurrences of nature. <br>
Women have no control over whether they happen or not and believe me, every single woman you ask will undoubtedly say that she would rather not have them. For me, I'd prefer a much less painful way for Mother Nature to alert me that no, I am not in fact pregnant. <br>
I was especially reminded of this in the wee hours of this morning, when, after alternating left and right hoping to find a side that was less painful to lean on, I was forced to drag myself out of bed to the medicine shelf. Without question, I HATE swallowing pills. I will stand there like a goldfish trying to force the damned thing down for a full ten minutes before succeeding. I prefer to be near someone too, in case my fear of choking comes true and I have to rely on that person's Heimlich manoeuvre to save me. <br>
Well, as it was the wee hours of morning, I had no one around to be the backup saviour, so I just chewed the pills instead. Unfortunately, for some reason, the painkilling effect never happened. <br>
Also, unfortunately, the air conditioning system in my house is a failure at controlling the temperature across the entire space. I am often awoken in the middle of the night by the overwhelming heat. <br>
Well, the pain from cramps was already causing me to cold sweat and loosen my grip on sanity so that I finally decided to use a heating pad (to ease the cramping) in an already sweltering room. After some time of sweating from both cold and heat, I fell asleep only to dream of being shot in the back by some soldiers from a corrupt government.
