I would like to dispel the myth that "Asians are smart". <br>
Out of all the possible stereotypes that could have been conjured, intellectual aptitude is the probably the last one I should complain about, yet this generalisation continues to rub me the wrong way. <br>
First of all, the element of race is something against which I highly object. Even though racism would naturally result as humans' way of explaining differences in salient physical features, it is <i>not an occurrence of nature</i>, but rather, a solely manmade construct disseminated throughout society. It is a mental shortcut people use to judge the value of others in relevance to their own lives. Nevertheless, as race has been reified and its associated stereotypes have become self-fulfilling prophecies in some cases, it is very much real and seems natural to people. <br>
A study was conducted to gauge the effect of gender and race on standardised math test performance. It is commonly espoused that men are better at math than women; also, that Asians are good at math. When Asian female subjects were told that the test would be more difficult for women than men, they lived down to this expectation and ended up performing worse than subjects who were not told this. However, when they were subtly reminded of their heritage, they performed better than subjects who were not reminded. Hence, race (and gender) obviously holds consequential meaning to people, enough to manifest itself in observable and measurable behaviours. <br>
<br>
Once, after I answered a difficult question correctly, a person complimented me, "You're so smart", to which another remarked, "That's because she's Asian." I was slightly taken aback. <br>
It wasn't the first time I'd been praised for being "smart", only the first time I'd heard this particular attribute explained by my race. Prior to this, I had always politely opposed the "smart" comment by insisting that it was, instead, the product of being hardworking. I firmly believed (and I still do) that all the academic success people witnessed was not due to some inherent part of me, but rather to an unwavering work ethic honed over an extensive period of time that required actual blood, sweat and tears. This incident really only reaffirmed my view -- I wasn't easily affected -- and encouraged me to continue to do so, as it planted in me the urge to convince people to see me as an individual person, not merely another one of a thousand faces of the same racial stereotype. In fact, I quite delight in breaking stereotypes. <br>
<br>
Today, I solved Einstein's riddle (see below) in about 30 minutes. This was half the time I took the first time I solved it, about 6 years ago in 8th grade. Of course, the timing is rigged because though I'd completely forgotten the details of the problem, I had gone through the thinking process once before -- but truthfully, more than once, except in a different way. Solving Einstein's riddle requires using the process of elimination as well as trial and error, which are incidentally also the exact tools needed to solve sudoku puzzles. Back in 5th grade, I'd had a phase involving sudoku puzzles in which I was obsessed with solving them. This was precisely (as far as I believe) what allowed me to solve Einstein's riddle relatively quickly. <br>
Ever heard of the 10,000 hour rule? According to this legendary axiom, it does not matter what activity it is, be it learning a musical instrument, playing a sport, learning a new language, etc., as long as one dedicates 10,000 hours toward it, one will have become a master musician, athlete, polyglot, etc. by the end. The way I see it, for every activity out there one could possibly do, one is born with a certain number of those 10,000 hours already fulfilled -- a time advantage. In other words, the activities for which one already exhibits above average performance at a young age -- talent, I daresay -- are the ones for which one can reach masterdom faster in comparison to people beginning with average performance or people who are stagnant and never put in any hours. <br>
As a child, though I do recall playing outside with friends quite often, I also spent a lot of time engaging in intellectually stimulating activities, such as reading outside of school, going to science museums and playing games like chess, checkers, etc. While I realise that of course other kids did these activities too, most people probably did not put in as many hours doing them as I did, so that my time advantage amounted to consistently high academic achievements seen by others later on. <br>
So no, I am not "smart". I am a person whose hard work gives her a time advantage over others, allowing her to rise above the norm. <br>
Solving Einstein's riddle rekindled my love for riddles (and Sherlock Holmes; I'm beyond exhilarated for season 4 of BBC's <i>Sherlock</i>) so I'll probably set up a riddles page now just for fun ^_^ <br>
<br>
I dare you, try to solve Einstein's riddle. I honestly had too much fun with it. If you want the answer, email me or just look it up. Einstein wrote this riddle in the early part of the 20th century. He said that 98% of the world could not solve it. Wanna prove that you're in the top 2% of human intelligence?<br>
