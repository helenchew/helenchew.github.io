My mother back then and also now: "Don't look so serious. You should smile more."<br>
My 7th grade teacher: "You need to loosen up. Smile!"<br>
Several of my mother's friends: "Your daughter would be so much prettier if she smiled more."<br>
<br>
As much as I want to throttle all of the above people for being blatantly sexist, brute force has never worked for me. Just as "You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink." so shall "You can teach a man anything, but you cannot make him think."<br>
<br>
And so that is why, though a protest was hurtling through my throat toward my mouth, I stopped it short by pursing my lips, incidentally revealing twin indentations on either side. Unfortunately, though obviously disgusted with the scene before me, I was unable to express it coherently by facial muscles alone. The dimples displayed so daringly on my cheeks belied the strong distaste I had for such offensive words. The dimples that showed themselves as blinking dots on my face whenever I chewed food. The dimples that had garnered me on multiple occasions gasps of envy and comments on how they enhanced my adorability. The dimples that are a result of a deformity in the zygomaticus major facial muscle. <br>
<br>
Yes, strangely enough, an abnormality of nature -- a shorter facial muscle than normal, apparent only when pulled taut to leave a visible gap as the dimple -- is celebrated in Western and Eastern cultures as attractive. I don't know how this happened, or why, but it only goes to show that beauty is whatever the hell you want it to be. <br>
<br>
When I was living in Singapore, we had a family friend of mixed race who was born with six toes on a foot and subsequently had the "extra" one surgically removed. Funny enough, polydactyly is actually a dominant trait in the human race. If a six-fingered person mated with a five-fingered person, the resulting child would have six fingers per hand (assuming the former was homozygous for that trait). Yet seeing such a sight is somewhat repulsive, simply because we have been conditioned to think so. <br>
<br>
In the movie <i>Gattaca</i>, Vincent and Irene attend a concert on their date, where they hear a beautiful piece played by a pianist. Irene remarks afterward, "That piece can only be played with twelve", referring to the exact number of fingers required to enact such a musical masterpiece. Indeed, without that which the majority of society would consider grotesque upon which to gaze, said society might never have had the pleasure of experiencing such an aesthetic. <br>
<br>
And if we are to go on within the context of facial features, might I add that American culture considers large lips framing a large mouth to be attractive (remember the whole Kylie Jenner affair?), whereas Chinese culture considers small lips bordering a small mouth to be so. In conclusion, each to his/her own!
