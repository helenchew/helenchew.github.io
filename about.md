Well, I started this blog out of pure boredom and also, I'll admit, because I'm slightly narcissistic and want to spread out the parts of my life over the territory of an entire website. I'll probably post excessively since I have to pay rent for this virtual space, so might as well go overboard. So this is more for me than for any poor soul who, by some twist of nature, happens upon what I like to call my Wonderland, where anything and everything can happen. Good luck trying to decipher my mind. But hey, you only need to ask to get an answer. <br>
<br>
Here's the history of all 19 and a half or so years of my life cut down to size in third person (because I've always wanted to refer to myself in third person):<br>
Born in New Zealand, Helen Chew was whisked away at four months old back to where she was originally conceived -- China -- to be cared for by her grandparents for 2 years, as her parents felt her presence was incompatible with their circumstances at the time. Upon discovering that Helen had become horribly spoilt, her mother immediately requested to have her back to undergo some intense parenting. At the age of 7, Helen and her family moved to Singapore, an otherwise perfect location to live for a lifetime, if it weren't for the proximity to the equator causing blistering heat every single day and a bout of rain every afternoon without fail. Sunburn and skin cancer don't play games. When Helen was 10 years old, the next stop for the family was Australia. First, it was Sydney, then Brisbane, and finally, Melbourne. About four years later, it was time to go onto the United States of America, in which she currently resides in Tampa, Florida. <br>

Back to first person in the present:<br>
Right now, I am a rising junior attending the University of Florida in Gainesville. I am on the biology preprofessional track, so I guess that means I'll end up being some sort of scientist in the future. My parents like to narrow it down to doctor, but I like to keep my options open.<br>
To be honest, science has never done it for me like the arts have. I have always been inclined to speak from the heart, rather than from the head, but I usually control my impulses. However, here, I plan to speak only from the heart.<br>
The only things I need in life (in no particular order) are good food, good music and good people. Yeah, I realise I'm asking for a lot, but <i>"I'm only human"</i> (as belted out by Christina Perri).
